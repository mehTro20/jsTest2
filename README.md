1. The getTestAverage function maps over the array of objects to get only the marks of each learner and then adds them with the reduce method into a single total. Then the total of the test is multiplied by the number of student for a class total and then the single total will be divided by the class total then that number multiplied by 100 is returned for the average percentage.

2. The sumOfString function is splitted to covert the single string into an array of all the items of the string and then is filtered such that any item that can't be converted to a number is filtered out of the array. Then array is mapped to convert the remaining items into numbers and the reduce method to add all those numbers together.

3. The removeNonNumbers function will take an array as an argument and then that array is filtered such that all data within the array that cannot be converted to a number, is filtered out of the array.
